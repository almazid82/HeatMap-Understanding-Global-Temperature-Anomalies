# HeatMap-Understanding-Global-Temperature-Anomalies

Climate change is one of the most pressing challenges of our time. But how do we *see* this change? Behind every news headline, policy shift, and global summit lies a stream of numbers — decades of temperature data recorded from every corner of the planet.

In this project, we dive deep into historical global temperature anomalies to uncover the patterns, shifts, and signals that tell the story of a warming Earth. Using heatmaps and powerful visual tools, we transform complex datasets into intuitive visuals that anyone can understand.

Through this data story, we aim to answer:

- How has the Earth's temperature changed over time?
- Are there specific decades or regions where warming is more prominent?
- What can past patterns tell us about the future?

This project is not just a technical exercise — it's a journey to make climate data accessible, visual, and actionable for everyone. Whether you're a researcher, policymaker, or curious mind, this story invites you to explore the temperature records that shape our understanding of the planet's future.

Let’s discover what the data says — and what it means for us all.

| **Median (50%)** | 1952.5 |
| **75th Percentile** | 1988.25 |
| **Maximum Year** | 2024 |

### **Skewness Analysis**  
Using `df.skew()` to check the distribution pattern:  
- **Temperature Anomalies:** Shows whether the dataset is **symmetrically distributed or skewed**  
- **Interpretation:** Helps identify trends in **global warming**  

## 🔍 Steps Covered  
✅ **Data Cleaning & Preparation**  
✅ **Handling Missing Values (`***` → `NaN`)**  
✅ **Checking Skewness (`df.skew()`)**  
✅ **Visualizing Trends Using Matplotlib & Seaborn**  


## 📊 Skewness Analysis  

### Understanding Skewness  
Skewness helps us determine whether the dataset is **symmetrically distributed** or **leaning more towards one side**.  
- **Positive Skew (> 0)** → Data is **right-skewed** (more lower values, long tail on the right).  
- **Negative Skew (< 0)** → Data is **left-skewed** (more higher values, long tail on the left).  
- **Skewness = 0** → Data is **perfectly symmetric**.

### 🔹 Skewness Results from the Dataset  
| Category | Skewness Value | Interpretation |
|----------|---------------|----------------|
| **Year** | `0.0` | Perfectly symmetrical distribution |
| **Jan-Dec** | `0.955` | Moderately **right-skewed**, indicating more lower temperature anomalies |
| **Dec-Nov** | `0.954` | Similar right-skewed trend as **Jan-Dec** |
| **Winter** | `0.765` | Right-skewed, but less extreme than summer/autumn |
| **Spring** | `0.851` | Right-skewed, showing more frequent lower values |
| **Summer** | `0.963` | Noticeably right-skewed, suggesting more lower anomalies |
| **Autumn** | `1.089` | Strongly right-skewed, indicating a heavy right tail |

### 🌍 Interpretation  
- **All seasonal categories show positive skewness**, meaning **lower temperature anomalies** are more frequent, but extreme highs exist.  
- **Autumn (1.089) has the strongest skew**, showing the highest variation in anomalies.  
- **Year column is 0.0**, indicating that time itself has a **balanced spread** within the dataset.  

🚀 This skewness analysis helps identify **how temperature distributions vary over different seasons**, providing insights into **climate change trends**!
